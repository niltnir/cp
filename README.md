# [Competitive Programming](https://github.com/niltnir/cp)

I tried competitive programming briefly a few years ago, and it was pretty fun.
I've only tried AtCoder Beginner problems, but I may look into others.

CP is also an excuse to study more algorithms and data structures. It's an
area I'm still lacking in, but hopefully, my math Olympiad experience can help
me along.
